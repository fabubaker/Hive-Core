# Sensor configuration file for a Hive provider.

# Each sensor that the provider wishes to expose to
# the Hive is added as follows:

- <Sensor Name>:
    - type: <VIDEO, AUDIO>
    
# Note that 'Sensor Name' must be unique within
# a provider instance. The same name must be used
# when initializing the sensor in the runtime.

# Use this file as a template for configuring your
# custom sensors on the provider device.
