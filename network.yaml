# Network configuration file for a Hive network.

# Each device in a Hive network is added as follows:

# - <Device Name>:
#     ip: <IP address of device>
#     port: <Port that is running a Hive instance>
#     type: <SEEKER, PROVIDER, QUEEN>

# The <Device Name> can be used internally
# when writing Hive apps.

# IMPORTANT: The same .yaml file must be used for all
# Hive runtimes in the network.

# Use this file as a template for configuring your
# custom Hive network.
